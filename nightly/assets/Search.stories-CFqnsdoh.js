The text can wrap up to 100 characters on small screens (size S) and
up to 300 characters on larger screens (size M and above). When text exceeds
these limits, it truncates with an ellipsis followed by a text expansion trigger.

Available options are:
- \`None\` (default) - The text will truncate with an ellipsis.
- \`Normal\` - The text will wrap (without truncation).
